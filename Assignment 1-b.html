    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
    <p>
        This is a simple paragraph with <i>italicized text</i> and 
        <u>underlined words</u>. Formatting helps improve readability 
        and highlights key points. You can use <i>italics</i> to emphasize 
        ideas, while <u>underlining</u> is great for drawing attention. 
        Styling text correctly makes content more engaging and visually appealing.
